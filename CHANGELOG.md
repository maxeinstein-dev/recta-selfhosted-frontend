## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pull request template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`: test plan, commit attribution, release impact, CHANGELOG gate and how to revert.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with setup, the gates to pass before pushing, commit attribution and contribution rules.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/): `npm test` runs `src/**/*.test.ts`, starting with tests for `sanitize`.
- `npm run check:tsc`: runs `tsc --noEmit` and fails only on an error that is not in `tsc-baseline.txt` (the 92 errors that already existed).
- Continuous integration on GitHub Actions: `check:tsc`, `lint`, `build` and `vitest` on every pull request and on `main`, on Node 20.19 and 22. On pull requests it also fails when `tsc-baseline.txt` grew compared with the base branch.
- Support for a backend running `AUTH_MODE=local`: the app asks the backend which sign-in mode it uses (`GET /auth/config`) and, in local mode, signs in and registers with email and password, with no Firebase configuration. Google sign-in and email verification are hidden in local mode, the sign-up link is hidden when the backend closes registration, and an expired session returns to the login page. Backends without `/auth/config` keep the Firebase behavior.
- Translated messages for local sign-in failures (wrong credentials, email already registered, invalid input).

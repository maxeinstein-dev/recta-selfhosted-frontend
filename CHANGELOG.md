All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows

`Fixed` and `Security`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pull request template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`: test plan, commit attribution, release impact, CHANGELOG gate and how to revert.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with setup, the gates to pass before pushing, commit attribution and contribution rules.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/): `npm test` runs `src/**/*.test.ts`, starting with tests for `sanitize`.
- `npm run check:tsc`: runs `tsc --noEmit` and fails only on an error that is not in `tsc-baseline.txt` (the 92 errors that already existed).
- Continuous integration on GitHub Actions: `check:tsc`, `lint`, `build` and `vitest` on every pull request and on `main`, on Node 20.19 and 22. On pull requests it also fails when `tsc-baseline.txt` grew compared with the base branch.
- Import bank statements from the Transactions page: pick the destination account and an OFX or CSV file, review the preview (new rows versus duplicates, plus the lines that could not be read and a warning for credit card invoices) and confirm. The dialog cannot be closed while the import is being written, says how far it got if the server stopped half way, and the button hides when the server has no importer. Texts are available in all eight languages.
- Component tests with jsdom and Testing Library (new devDependencies) for the import dialog.

### Changed

- The credit card form asks for a single closing day instead of the "best day" offset. Typing the due day fills the closing day with due day - 7 (due 9 closes on 2, due 3 on 26) until the user types their own; the card page shows the effective closing day as the best day to buy, and installments use it too.
- Creating an account from the app (`addAccount`) now sends `closingDay` to the API, and no longer sends `bestDayOffset`.

### Fixed

- Installments on a card without a stored closing day are placed in the right invoice, using the closing day derived from the due day.
